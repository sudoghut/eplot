# eplot

A web platform that uses AI to extract and index anime episode abstracts, making it easier to find specific episodes through text search rather than watching videos.

## About

eplot was created to solve a common problem: finding specific anime episodes when you remember the content but not the episode number. Instead of having to watch through multiple episodes to find the right one, eplot provides:

- AI-generated episode abstracts/plots
- Text-based search functionality
- Browse-able episode summaries

## Contributing

1. Opening an issue in this GitHub repository
2. Describing the problem you found
3. Providing any relevant context or corrections
